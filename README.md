## Title: 
Determining reasons about a topic or event
## Abstract:
A 150 word description of the project idea and goals. What’s the motivation behind your project? What story would you like to tell, and why?
## Research Questions: 
A list of research questions you would like to address during the project.
## Proposed additional datasets (if any): 
List the additional dataset(s) you want to use (if any), and some ideas on how you expect to get, manage, process, and enrich it/them. Show us that you’ve read the docs and some examples, and that you have a clear idea on what to expect. Discuss data size and format if relevant. It is your responsibility to check that what you propose is feasible.
## Methods: 
1.	Choose a topic under study (i.e., “Brexit”)
2.	For supporting/against their opinion Categorize the opinions of the speakers in positive/supportive or negative/against that topic
3.	Search for other terms that appear in the quotes, trying to get the common ones for the supportive (i.e., “historical reasons” or “immigration”) and against opinions (i.e., “economy” or “travel”)
4.	Visualize and present the “basic” data
5.	(optional) Enrich the data with Wikidata, linking the speakers with more information (age, nationality, gender, occupation…) This information could be used to enrich point 2 (for example, show the opinion of the speakers in a map depending on their place of birth), or with point 3 (for example, show the main reasons for supporting/against their opinion in a map depending on their place of birth
6.	(optional) Add the time variable (based on the Brexit analysis idea), specially showing important events about the topic under study. As point 5, this can be applied to point 2 (showing the change in the opinion of the speakers during time), or with point 3 (showing the change in the reasons for supporting/against their opinion)
7.	(optional) Apply this model to other topics under study (?)
## Proposed timeline: 
Combining it with the Brexit analysis idea. We can add the “time” variable, in order to add specific events and see the changes in the reasons of the speakers over the time.

## Organization within the team: 
A list of internal milestones up until project Milestone 3.
## Questions for TAs (optional): 
Add here any questions you have for us related to the proposed project.
