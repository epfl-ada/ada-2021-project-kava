## Title: 
Why did Brexit occur?
Determining the reasons why Brexit won over the permanence in the UE based on quotes analysis. 
Determining the arguments people use to support or neglect Brexit based on quotes analysis. 

## Abstract:
A 150 word description of the project idea and goals. What’s the motivation behind your project? What story would you like to tell, and why?

## Research Questions: 
A list of research questions you would like to address during the project:
- Which percentage of the speakers supported or was against Brexit?
- What arguments did the members of each category use to support their beliefs? (i.e., “historical reasons” or “immigration” in favour; i.e., “economy” or “travel” against). 
- Who were the main supporters of each of the categories? Analyze them according to age, nationality, gender, occupation, place of residence.  
- How did the opinion towards Brexit change during the 5 year span? Did the arguments of each group also change?

## Proposed additional datasets (if any): 
List the additional dataset(s) you want to use (if any), and some ideas on how you expect to get, manage, process, and enrich it/them. Show us that you’ve read the docs and some examples, and that you have a clear idea on what to expect. Discuss data size and format if relevant. It is your responsibility to check that what you propose is feasible.

## Methods: 
¿Mathematical methods?

## Organization within the team: 
A list of internal milestones up until project Milestone 3.
- Categorize the opinions of the speakers in positive/supportive or negative/against towards Brexit
- Extract the most common arguments in each category: search for other terms that appear in the quotes, trying to get the common ones for the supportive (i.e., “historical reasons” or “immigration”) and against opinions (i.e., “economy” or “travel”)
- Classify the speakers in each category and filter them according to age, nationality, gender, occupation, place of residence: enrich the data with Wikidata?
- Visualize and present the data
- (future line) Add the time variable, specially showing important events about the topic under study.

## Proposed timeline: 
Combining it with the Brexit analysis idea. We can add the “time” variable, in order to add specific events and see the changes in the reasons of the speakers over the time.
6.	(optional) Add the time variable (based on the Brexit analysis idea), specially showing important events about the topic under study. As point 5, this can be applied to point 2 (showing the change in the opinion of the speakers during time), or with point 3 (showing the change in the reasons for supporting/against their opinion)
7.	(optional) Apply this model to other topics under study (?)


## Questions for TAs (optional): 
Add here any questions you have for us related to the proposed project.
